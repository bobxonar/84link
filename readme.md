# 84link  

84link is a tool to convert z80 binaries into TI-83+/84 calculator .8xp files.  
This is intended to replace devpac8x, a tool that only works these days with a DOS emulator.  

## Build process  

To bulid, you will need `gcc` (or any C compiler if you edit the makefile) and GNU Make.  
Go to this directory in a command prompt and type `make` to build.  
Currently, the makefile builds for windows. If you'd like, change the .exe extension in the makefile to whatever you want.
